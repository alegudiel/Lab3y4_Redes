# Lab3y4_Redes

## Description of the project
Knowing where to send messages for any router makes sending messages trivial.
It is only necessary to know the final destination and it is forwarded to the neighbor that can provide the best route to the destination. All that information is stored in the routing tables. However, with the dynamism with which the Internet is expected to function, it is necessary for these tables to be able to be updated and accommodate changes in the infrastructure. The algorithms with which these tables are updated are known as routing algorithms.
